## Introduction

The PiratesTutorial is a [SpatialOS](https://improbable.io/) project with an implementation of a basic pirates game.

* Learn how to set up and use SpatialOS.
* Add new functionality to the game.

To build this project, you will need access to the [SpatialOS SDK](https://spatialos.improbable.io/get-spatialos), and to have set it up on your machine (see the setup guides for [Windows](https://spatialos.improbable.io/docs/latest/setup-spatialos/win) or [Mac](https://spatialos.improbable.io/docs/latest/setup-spatialos/mac)).
